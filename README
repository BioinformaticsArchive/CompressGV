Improvements in speed and cost of genome sequencing are resulting in increasing numbers of novel non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in genes known to be associated with disease. The large number of nsSNPs makes laboratory-based classification infeasible and familial co-segregation with disease is not always possible. In silico methods for classification or triage are thus required.

We derived a means of quantitatively clustering known neutral and deleterious nsSNPs from the same gene; this was then used to assign novel variants to the most appropriate cluster as a means of binary classification. Scaling of clusters between genes allowed for modelling of all known neutral and deleterious nsSNPs using well-established statistical distributions. These can be used for updating of a priori estimates of the probability of deleterious classification.

The underlying methodology is easily generalised to incorporate alternative amino acid properties.
